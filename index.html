        <p><b>Friday Media Group - Product Manager</b></p>

        <h2> Previous Role </h2>
        <p><b>Product Owner – Enterprise Tools DevOps Analyst – Eli Lilly (Emerging technology team)</b></p>
        <p>Aug 2016 to March 2018</p>
        <p>The Cirrus team (emerging technology team) expanded to include the enterprise tools team. This
            teams primary function is to identify embed and scale enterprise wide tools to the enterprise,
            primarily focused on the developer experience. My role being a product owner, focused on
            maturing the enterprise wide tools by driving business value, whilst improving the developer
            experience. Specific ownership of GitHub, Slack & more complex tools for the enterprise.
            Experience in creating detailed roadmaps for products and working with key stakeholders to
            manage the future vision of these products. Also experience in rolling out services from the ground
            up. I lead the roll out of GitHub & Slack, including procurement, documentation through to the
            setting up the orgs.</p>

        <h2>Work Experiance</h2>

        <p><b>Eli Lilly – Demand Lead and Business Relationship Manager – Cirrus (Emerging Technology team)</b></p>
        <p>Oct 2016 to Aug 2017</p>
        <p> Responsibilities expanded to include the demand intake process in Lilly's emerging technology space. Focused on bringing technology solutions from initial ideation into solution architecture conversations that align with the overall IT strategy and eventually into the development process following Agile methodology.</p>


        <p><b>Eli Lilly – Technical Analyst – Cirrus (Emerging Technology team)</b></p>
        <p>Jul 2015 to Aug 2017</p>
        <p>Since returning to Lilly, my current role is a technical analyst in the emerging technology team. The vision for this team within the company is to roll out new technology to support the IT functions and to create and support enterprise wide applications, which support internal business functions, or external launches. This team is the only one in the company that works in a fully agile manner, following the Agile methodology.</p>

        <p>One of my main roles is a combination of a system and business analyst on Large-scale web applications. Within this role I am responsible for understanding the business and making recommendations for any
          improvements needed, I can then convert the business need into technical tasks and deliver the requirements in a user story format for the development team to consume. I enjoy this role immensely as I get to interact with new customers and build strong relationships to strengthen the teams’ brand. By merging the understanding of the business aspect of the role with the ability to delve into more technical scenarios, I am able to fully assist the development team on the ground when needed.</p>

        <p>I have experience in playing the role of product owner on projects, I have been a product owner of an enterprise wide form building application where I have looked after its vision, positioning and roadmap for nine months; during this time there was dramatically increased the usage of the application. It was recently used internally for a Lilly global conference where it was available for use within the whole company. I have successfully delivered multiple projects that include global stakeholders and offshore developers. I have plentiful experience in working with the business and technical teams, with each project bringing its own challenges and opportunities for success. I thrive in working with new teams and have a real passion for customer experience.
        </p>

        <p>One area that I have a keen passion for is leading and motivating teams; I have experience in playing a mentor and scrum lead for a group of five placement students (one BA and four developers). This student development team has created four applications within two months following a fully Agile methodology. My role is to manage the team, set up their backlog and coordinate and run the sprints. I enjoy the daily interaction with the team and the problem solving that occurs on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>Another aspect of my position is rolling out new technology to the enterprise for Lilly IT teams to consume. Within one year I rolled out GitHub and Slack as a service including creating quality documentation, assessment of the services and vendors and creating a roll out plan to the all IT functions within Lilly. This involved a different style of communication and planning to my other roles, via interacting heavily with different external companies to drive tight timelines.</p>
